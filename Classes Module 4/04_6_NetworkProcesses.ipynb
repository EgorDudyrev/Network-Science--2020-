It contains buyers as well as sellers of escort services. Contains about 15.000 nodes. As it is the real-world dataset, is it interesting to test a epidemic model on it. Use SIRS model- modification of SIR model, as 'recovering' nodes return to susceptible population after some time. Also, modify model to count recovery in days, not probabilistically.\n",
