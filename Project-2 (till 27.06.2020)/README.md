# Competition
If you current score (Project+MidTerm) is below 13.5 (DS program) or below 11.5 (FinTech program), you automatically pass the second project in a form of competition, in which all the participants will be graded according to their rank. You can still participate in other projects, but have to succeed in competition, because your project will be graded by its results (with potential bonuses from second project if you decide to take part in two projects). Grade 4 is achieved when you outperform suggested baselines.

For each competition, we need one student, who will curate competition, deploying baseline solutions, verifying submissions and posting new verified results on general board. He/She gets extra two points to the Project grade.
